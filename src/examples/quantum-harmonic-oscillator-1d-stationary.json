As an arbitrary smooth \npotential can roughly approximated as a \nharmonic potential at the vicinity of a stable \nequilibrium point, it is one of the most \nwell-studied models in quantum mechanics. \n\n<p>It is one of the few quantum-mechanical \nsystems for which a closed-form solution is \nknown. Its energy levels are quantized as:\n\n<pre>E<sub>n</sub>=&hbar;&omega;(n+Â½)</pre>\n\n<p>where &hbar; is the Planck constant and &omega;=&Sqrt;(k/m), with k being the force\nconstant and m being the mass.\n\n<p>This page shows the stationary states of\nthe one-dimensional (1D) quantum harmonic oscillator.
