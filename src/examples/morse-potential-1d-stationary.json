It is a better approximation for the vibrational structure of the molecule than the quantum harmonic oscillator as it accounts for the anharmonicity of real chemical bonds and allows for bond breaking. It is written as:\n\n<p>V(x) = D[(1-exp(-&beta;(x-x<sub>0</sub>)))<sup>2</sup>-1]\n\n<p>where D is the depth of the potential well, x<sub>0</sub> is the equilibrium bond length, and &beta; is the force constant. The energy levels of a Morse potential well are quantized as:\n\n<pre>E<sub>n</sub>=&hbar;&omega;(n+½)-[&hbar;&omega;(n+½)]<sup>2</sup>/(4D)</pre>\n\n<p>where &hbar; is the Planck constant and &omega;=&Sqrt;(2D/m)&beta;/2&pi;, with m being the mass.\n\n<p>This page shows the stationary states of\nthe one-dimensional (1D) Morse potential well.
