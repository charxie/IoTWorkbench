The locations of the fixed points \nare called nodes, and the locations where the \namplitude is maximum are called antinodes.\n\nStanding waves are the solutions of the wave \nequation when the initial conditions are sinusoidal. \nIn one dimension, the wave equation is written as:\n\n∂U²/∂t² = c²∂U²/∂x²\n\nwhere U is the displacement, t is time, x is the\ndistance, and c is the traveling speed. The initial \ncondition is:\n\nU(x, 0) = sin(πx/b)\n\nAnd the boundary conditions for the two end \npoints are:\n\nU(0, t) = 0\nU(L, t) = 0\n\nThe above conditions are essential for the \nformation of standing waves. If the two end \npoints are not fixed at the zero position, you \nmay see some interesting patterns, but not \nstanding waves.\n\nYou can imagine this system as a vibrating \nstring that is fixed at the two end points.","decimals":3,"color":"#808080","textColor":"#ffffff"},{"name":"b","uid":"Slider #170892f4d40","x":315,"y":425,"width":100,"height":60,"minimum":0.5,"maximum":5,"steps":9,"value":1,"source":false,"snapToTick":true,"valuePrecision":2},{"name":"Initial Condition","uid":"Grapher #1708934e1cc","x":815,"y":285,"width":277,"height":267,"dataPortNumber":1,"xAxisLabel":"x","yAxisLabel":"U","graphWindowColor":"white","autoscale":false,"minimumValue":-1,"maximumValue":1,"lineTypes":["Solid","Solid"],"lineColors":["gray","gray"],"graphSymbols":["None","None"],"graphSymbolColors":["white","white"]}],"connectorStates":[{"inputPortId":"DX","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"FDM Solver Block #1707f61d33b","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f6266e7"},{"inputPortId":"X0","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"FDM Solver Block #1707f61d33b","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f72637d"},{"inputPortId":"X","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Series Block #1707f639a25","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f72637d"},{"inputPortId":"N","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Series Block #1707f639a25","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f5d0fc2"},{"inputPortId":"D","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Series Block #1707f639a25","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f6266e7"},{"inputPortId":"X","outputPortId":"S","inputBlockId":"Unary Function Block #1707f73a88f","outputBlockId":"Series Block #1707f639a25"},{"inputPortId":"AI","outputPortId":"R","inputBlockId":"FDM Solver Block #1707f61d33b","outputBlockId":"Unary Function Block #1707f73a88f"},{"inputPortId":"X","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Grapher #1707f74afbf","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f72637d"},{"inputPortId":"D","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Grapher #1707f74afbf","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f6266e7"},{"inputPortId":"DT","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"FDM Solver Block #1707f61d33b","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f62afc0"},{"inputPortId":"NX","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"FDM Solver Block #1707f61d33b","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f5d0fc2"},{"inputPortId":"NT","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"FDM Solver Block #1707f61d33b","outputBlockId":"Worker Block #170846f2000"},{"inputPortId":"I","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Worker Block #170846f2000","outputBlockId":"Switch #170846f3186"},{"inputPortId":"R","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Worker Block #170846f2000","outputBlockId":"Action Block #17084795ca4"},{"inputPortId":"X","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Global Variable Block #1707f76e218","outputBlockId":"Slider #170892f4d40"},{"inputPortId":"I","outputPortId":"R","inputBlockId":"Grapher #1708934e1cc","outputBlockId":"Unary Function Block #1707f73a88f"},{"inputPortId":"I","outputPortId":"AF","inputBlockId":"Grapher #1707f74afbf","outputBlockId":"FDM Solver Block #1707f61d33b"},{"inputPortId":"D","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Grapher #1708934e1cc","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f6266e7"},{"inputPortId":"X","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Grapher #1708934e1cc","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f72637d"}],"mcuStates":[],"hatStates":[],"attachmentStates":[],"blockViewState":{"backgroundColor":"rgb(212, 208, 200)","blockStyle":"Shade"}}
