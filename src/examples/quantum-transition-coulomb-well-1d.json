The Coulomb well \ncan be regarded as a simple model of an atom \n(the bottom is simplified to be flat to simulate the \ncancellation of the Coulombic attraction from the \nnucleus and the Coulombic repulsion from other \nelectrons of the atom). \n\nYou can set the initial state and the frequency of \nthe alternating electrical field. The default initial\nstate is the ground state and the default frequency\ncorresponds to the energy difference between\nthe first excited state and the ground state.\n\nThere are a few interesting things to observe in\nthis simulation:\n\n1) Frequency vs. intensity. Whether a quantum \ntransition is possible is solely determined by the \nfrequency of the electrical field. Changing the \nintensity has no effect in making a transition \nhappen, if the frequency is not right. However, \nif the frequency is right, increasing intensity \ncan accelerate the transition.\n\n2) Time for transition. Transitions between two \nadjacent states happen more quickly than those \nbetween non-adjacent states.\n\n3) The selection rule and forbidden transitions. \nTransitions between some states will not happen. \nFor example, the transition from the ground state\nto the second excited state does not occur.
