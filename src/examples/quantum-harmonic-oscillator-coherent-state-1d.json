In a one-dimensional position basis, the Schrödinger equation can be written as:\n\n<pre>i&hbar;&part;&Psi;(x,t)/&part;t=[-&hbar;<sup>2</sup>&nabla;<sup>2</sup>/(2m)+V(x,t)]&Psi;(x,t)</pre>\n\n<p>where m is the mass of the particle and V(x, t) is the potential energy function (in the most generic case, it may also be time-varying).\n\n<p>This page shows the motion of a probability density function of a quantum harmonic oscillator in 1D. The system is initially at the ground state with an initial momentum. As you can see, the behavior of a quantum harmonic oscillator resembles that of a classical one to some extent. It is said that the oscillator is in a <b>coherent state</b>.\n\n<p>A coherent state is not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, as you can see from the probability distribution in the energy level view on the left of the simulation window. When we perform a measurement of energy, the oscillator in such a state has a considerable chance to be discovered at a few different energy levels. The higher amplitude the oscillator, the greater the probability to find it at a higher energy level.","decimals":3,"color":"#808080","textColor":"#ffffff","useHtml":true,"keepResult":false},{"name":"x0","uid":"Slider #1729939a127","x":371,"y":77,"width":100,"height":60,"minimum":-10,"maximum":10,"steps":20,"value":-10,"source":true,"snapToTick":true,"valuePrecision":2},{"name":"Series Block","uid":"Series Block #1729939b60f","x":502,"y":135,"width":60,"height":100,"start":-10,"increment":0.2,"count":100},{"name":"dx","uid":"Slider #172993aa70d","x":371,"y":143,"width":100,"height":60,"minimum":0.1,"maximum":0.2,"steps":10,"value":0.2,"source":true,"snapToTick":true,"valuePrecision":2},{"name":"nx","uid":"Slider #172993b290d","x":369,"y":211,"width":100,"height":60,"minimum":50,"maximum":200,"steps":15,"value":100,"source":true,"snapToTick":true,"valuePrecision":3},{"uid":"Univariate Function Block #1729945f0c7","variableName":"x","expression":"k*x*x/2","x":587,"y":152,"width":127,"height":72},{"name":"Global Variable Block","key":"k","value":0.009999999999999997,"initialValue":"0.1","showValue":false,"uid":"Global Variable Block #1729946ff5f","x":528,"y":24,"width":80,"height":60,"fractionDigits":1},{"name":"k","uid":"Slider #17299475e1d","x":370,"y":11,"width":100,"height":60,"minimum":0,"maximum":0.1,"steps":10,"value":0.009999999999999997,"source":false,"snapToTick":true,"valuePrecision":2},{"uid":"Quantum Dynamics 1D Block #1729fd06503","x":755,"y":12,"width":532,"height":370,"name":"Quantum Dynamics (1D)","wavepacketColor":"#31bfe3","viewWindowColor":"white","maxState":10,"nPoints":100,"timeStep":0.2,"initialState":0,"initialWavepacketWidth":2,"initialWavepacketPosition":5,"initialMomentum":1,"potentialName":"Custom","method":"Runge-Kutta","solverSteps":20,"energyScale":2000,"dampingFactor":0,"showWaveFunction":true,"showProbabilityDensity":true,"showStateSpace":true},{"name":"Start","uid":"Switch #172a3cc1b4c","x":371,"y":281,"width":80,"height":60,"checked":false},{"name":"Step","uid":"Worker Block #172a3cefc70","x":492,"y":320,"width":96,"height":73,"outputType":"Natural Number","interval":50,"repeatTimes":1000},{"name":"Action","uid":"Action Block #172a4371815","x":371,"y":356,"width":80,"height":60,"type":"Reset","symbol":"Reset"}],"connectorStates":[{"inputPortId":"X","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Series Block #1729939b60f","outputBlockId":"Slider #1729939a127"},{"inputPortId":"D","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Series Block #1729939b60f","outputBlockId":"Slider #172993aa70d"},{"inputPortId":"N","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Series Block #1729939b60f","outputBlockId":"Slider #172993b290d"},{"inputPortId":"X","outputPortId":"S","inputBlockId":"Univariate Function Block #1729945f0c7","outputBlockId":"Series Block #1729939b60f"},{"inputPortId":"X","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Global Variable Block #1729946ff5f","outputBlockId":"Slider #17299475e1d"},{"inputPortId":"I","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Worker Block #172a3cefc70","outputBlockId":"Switch #172a3cc1b4c"},{"inputPortId":"R","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Worker Block #172a3cefc70","outputBlockId":"Action Block #172a4371815"},{"inputPortId":"X0","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Quantum Dynamics 1D Block #1729fd06503","outputBlockId":"Slider #1729939a127"},{"inputPortId":"DX","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Quantum Dynamics 1D Block #1729fd06503","outputBlockId":"Slider #172993aa70d"},{"inputPortId":"IN","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Quantum Dynamics 1D Block #1729fd06503","outputBlockId":"Worker Block #172a3cefc70"},{"inputPortId":"VX","outputPortId":"R","inputBlockId":"Quantum Dynamics 1D Block #1729fd06503","outputBlockId":"Univariate Function Block #1729945f0c7"}],"mcuStates":[],"hatStates":[],"attachmentStates":[],"blockViewState":{"backgroundColor":"rgb(212, 208, 200)","blockStyle":"Shade"}}
