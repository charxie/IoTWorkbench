This phenomenon is called the \ncoherent state (a.k.a. the Glauber state \nor the quasi-classical state). In this case, \nthe behavior of the quantum particle is \nclosest to that of the corresponding \nclassical particle.\n \nIf the wave packet has a width that is \ndifferent from that of the probability \nwave function of the ground state, then \nits shape will undergo significant changes \nduring the motion. Since the width of the \nwave packet and the height of the peak \ncan vary, this phenomenon is called the \nsqueezed state, including an amplitude-\nsqueezed state (the amplitude decreases \nwhen the wave packet moves to the center), \nand a phase-squeezed state (the phase \nvolume decreases when the wave packet \ntravels to the center). \n\nSqueezed optical states show remarkable \nability to suppress quantum noise, which \nhave been used in quantum communication\nand cryptography.","decimals":3,"color":"#808080","textColor":"#ffffff","useHtml":false,"keepResult":false},{"name":"x0","uid":"Slider
