{"blockStates":[{"name":"Anharmonicity and Qubit","uid":"Sticker #17296c8d695","x":6,"y":5,"width":265,"height":692,"marginX":15,"marginY":15,"userText":"Any two-state system can be made into \na qubit. Sometimes we can make a \ntwo-state system by picking only two \nstates out of the many states of a larger \nsystem. For example, the ground state \nand an excited state.\n\nYou may have heard that the quantum \nharmonic oscillator, a pet model of\nscientists that is also important in \nquantum computing, cannot be used \nto build a qubit. For that matter, scientists\nmust use an anharmonic oscillator. \n\nThe simulations in this page explain why.\nWe use the Morse potential with an \nadjustable anharmonicity to create two\npotential energy functions, one with a\nmuch greater anharmonicity than the\nother. In the more harmonic case (we will\njust refer to it as the harmonic oscillator), \nthe quantized energy levels are almost \nequally spaced, whereas in the less\nharmonic case (we will just refer to it as\nthe anharmonic oscillator), they are clearly \nnot. In both cases, an alternating electrical \nfield with the frequency corresponding\nto the energy difference between the\nground state |0⟩ and the first excited state \n|1⟩ is used to manipulate the system, in\nhope to single out the two states to create \na qubit and tune it. \n\nWhen we run the quantum dynamics\nsimulation, it becomes obvious that the\nanharmonic oscillator can switch back\nand forth between the two states, but\nthe harmonic oscillator cannot. I will\nleave the why question to you. But this\nis the reason why scientists must build\nmicrostructures that have sufficient\nanharmonicity to create a qubit.","decimals":3,"color":"#808080","textColor":"#ffffff","useHtml":false,"keepResult":false},{"name":"x0","uid":"Slider
