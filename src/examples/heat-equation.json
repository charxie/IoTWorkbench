The heat equation is \nmathematically equivalent to Fick's Second Law of \nDiffusion. So it can be used to model the diffusion of\nsubstance as well.\n\nThis page shows how the PDE Solver Block can be \nused to solve the heat equation in one dimension. \nThe initial temperature distribution is set to be a \nGaussian function with the peak at zero.\n\nThe PDE Solver Block requires the discretization\nof multiple variables, which in the case of the heat\nequation is t and x. Currently, the block provides\nthe explicit and implicit methods. The default is\nthe implicit method, which is unconditionally stable. \nThe explicit method may be more accurate, but\nits numerical stability will be compromised when\nthe steplength increases.","decimals":3,"color":"#808080","textColor":"#ffffff"}],"connectorStates":[{"inputPortId":"DX","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"FDM Solver Block #1707f61d33b","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f6266e7"},{"inputPortId":"X0","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"FDM Solver Block #1707f61d33b","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f72637d"},{"inputPortId":"X","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Series Block #1707f639a25","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f72637d"},{"inputPortId":"N","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Series Block #1707f639a25","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f5d0fc2"},{"inputPortId":"D","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Series Block #1707f639a25","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f6266e7"},{"inputPortId":"X","outputPortId":"S","inputBlockId":"Unary Function Block #1707f73a88f","outputBlockId":"Series Block #1707f639a25"},{"inputPortId":"AI","outputPortId":"R","inputBlockId":"FDM Solver Block #1707f61d33b","outputBlockId":"Unary Function Block #1707f73a88f"},{"inputPortId":"X","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Grapher #1707f74afbf","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f72637d"},{"inputPortId":"D","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Grapher #1707f74afbf","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f6266e7"},{"inputPortId":"J","outputPortId":"AF","inputBlockId":"Grapher #1707f74afbf","outputBlockId":"FDM Solver Block #1707f61d33b"},{"inputPortId":"DT","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"FDM Solver Block #1707f61d33b","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f62afc0"},{"inputPortId":"NX","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"FDM Solver Block #1707f61d33b","outputBlockId":"Slider #1707f5d0fc2"},{"inputPortId":"NT","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"FDM Solver Block #1707f61d33b","outputBlockId":"Worker Block #170846f2000"},{"inputPortId":"I","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Worker Block #170846f2000","outputBlockId":"Switch #170846f3186"},{"inputPortId":"R","outputPortId":"O","inputBlockId":"Worker Block #170846f2000","outputBlockId":"Action Block #17084795ca4"},{"inputPortId":"I","outputPortId":"R","inputBlockId":"Grapher #1707f74afbf","outputBlockId":"Unary Function Block #1707f73a88f"}],"mcuStates":[],"hatStates":[],"attachmentStates":[],"blockViewState":{"backgroundColor":"rgb(212, 208, 200)","blockStyle":"Shade"}}
